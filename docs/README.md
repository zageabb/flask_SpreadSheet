# Documentation Index

This folder contains deeper references for the Flask Spreadsheet project. Start here to explore detailed architecture plans, API contracts, and operational guidance.

- [System Architecture](architecture.md)
- [API Contracts](api-contracts.md)
- [Data Lifecycle](data-lifecycle.md)
- [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)
- [Operations Guide](operations.md)

Each document is kept in sync with the application code. When implementing new capabilities (e.g., background jobs, caching, or data pipelines) update the relevant reference to reflect the latest behaviour and operational requirements.
